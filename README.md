# Multiple-Imputation-for-validating-prediction-models

This is a model-based simulation study into the different transformation methods for the C-statistic.  
The goal is to find suitable transformations of the C-statistic estimates of prediction models created using multply imputed data set such that these can be pooled appropriately.
This yields an overall measure that is capable of accurately capturing the discriminatory ability of a predictive model generated based on multiply imputed data.
