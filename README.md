# Multiple-Imputation-for-validating-prediction-models

This is a model-based simulation study into the different transformation methods for the C-statistic.  
The goal is to find an appropriate transformation such that C-statistic estimates of prediction models created using multply imputed data set can be pooled appropriately.
This yields an overall measure that is capable of accurately capturing the discriminatory ability of a predictive model generated based on multiply imputed data.
