# Multiple-Imputation-for-validating-prediction-models

This is a model-based simulation study into the different transformation methods for the c-statistic.  
The goal is to find suitable transformations of c-statistic estimates of prediction models created using multply imputed data sets such that these can be pooled appropriately. The  coverage and bias of the methods are evaluated to ascertain which is most suitable.
